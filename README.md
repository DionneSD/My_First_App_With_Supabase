# ⚡️ My First App Using Supabase - A solution to boredom 💪

This project was built using NetNinja's tutorials on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydz7Dj5QHKY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hUb6sHthUEwG7r9VDPBMKO). The original app was a smoothie selector website but I adapted it to my own needs to create an app where I could add cards with different activities and the length of time it would take me to complete them. On a day where I'm feeling a bit bored, I can visit my app and browse the activities I've got - boredom be gone!

## 🔧 Tech Stack

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Supabase

## 🧱 How I built the app

This app was built by following the NetNinja tutorials on Youtube and adapting each step to my own needs. I plan to tinker with the app by:

1. playing around with the CSS to make it look visually pleasing to me
2. refactoring the CSS for a mobile first design so that I can use it on my mobile
3. deploying it so that I can access it anywhere boredom may strike 🌩️
4. playing with Supabase so that I can add security to my boredom solver and perhaps allow for my partner to create an account too

## 📚 What I learnt

- how to set up Supabase and how to use Supabase in an app (TODO: explain here!)
- what RLS is and why it's important when configuring an app using Supabase (although I haven't implemented it yet) (TODO: explain here!)
