1. play around with css a bit - decide background, card layer on top, font colour on top of that (plus added button layer)
2. add login (play around with policies - do I want to have separate activities based on user? if so how does that affect my tables?)
3. look into responsiveness to make app more responsive (especially for mobile!)
4. deploy?
